# Google Translate repeater

I like using Dropwizard as my http server as choice. I use it a lot and every
time, I copy common files from other projects. I figure I might as well make a
template for getting started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Requires Java 8 and Gradle 4.4 to be installed.

### Build Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanbutler/googletranslate.git
cd googletranslate
./gradlew :dropwizard-template:clean :dropwizard-template:shadowJar
java -jar dropwizard-template/root.jar server dropwizard-template/local.yaml
```

## Built With

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.1.4/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release23) - Utility functions
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Annotations for less boilerplate code

## Contributing

Fork the project and submit a PR and one of the maintainers will be in touch.
